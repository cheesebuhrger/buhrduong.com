            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>
                Wheel (formerly Enzyme Health) had low engagement with its clinician web app. The product acted as an
                onboarding tool for clinicians to start working with clients/companies on the Wheel platform, and after
                onboarding, there was no real use for it. The primary touchpoint was assignment emails, which directed
                clinicians to the corresponding client's portal, where the Wheel clinician would interact with the
                client's patient and provide the appropriate treatment. The redesign aimed to fix the core workflow
                inefficiencies and provide a tool centered around the human needs of Wheel clinicians.
            </p>
            <p>
                Early interviews were conducted to help solidify the problem that was solved. Hypotheses were created to
                "test" prototypes throughout the design process and the redesign post-launch. The final design included
                "next patient" emphasis on the home page and the "utility bar" to narrow the gulf of execution, visual
                emphasis on completion earnings to reduce semantic distance/evaluation, and online/offline toggling to
                improve SLA.
            </p>
            <p>
                The results indicated an increase in operational efficiency, a decrease in assignments rerouted before
                getting completed, a faster visit completion time, and an increase in clinician happiness.

            <p>
                As the only designer at the company, my role in developing this product spanned the end-to-end UX design
                process, including user studies, information architecture, design system, interaction design, visual
                design,
                motion, and prototyping. I worked alongside our CPO, Head of Ops, Chief Medical Officer, and two
                Engineers
                in various steps.

            <h2>The Exam Room</h2>
            <p>
                The product that we shipped to our clinicians was a digital office away from the clinic. A space
                where administrative work is not a concern. A practice where they direct their full attention to
                delivering care to patients.

            <p>
                The next patient is in plain view, reducing the number of clinicians' pathways to achieve their
                goal. Their saved mental resources can focus on making the correct assessment and crafting a
                thoughtful care plan for patients.

                After clinicians have completed their visit, they can move onto their next patient with a single action,

        <h2>A Digital office Wheel Clinicians Love</h2>
        <p>
            A month after the rollout, we saw overall positive results on our KPIs. Our Slack channel connected to our
            CSAT
            platform pushed clinician happiness scores, including clinician feedback about the newly redesigned product.
        </p>

            <h4>Initial Problem</h4>
            <h2>There was very little engagement with the product after clinicians onboarded</h2>
            <p>
                Up until this point, the purpose of the clinician web app was to onboard new clinicians. After that
                step, there was no real functionality except to view clinical protocols and training materials, and even
                those
                linked to Google Docs. Alongside the web app, clinicians would receive notification for every new
                assignment, also known as an
                "async consult" or "patient visit." Clicking the notification link would take the clinician to the
                client's portal, where the patient visit would occur. Once the clinician completed the visit, they would
                receive
                a notification for their next assignment. There wasn't any real reason for clinicians to use the web app
                after that because their core workflow started with an email and ended on the client's portal.
            </p>
            <img src="">
            <img src="">
            <img src="">
            <p>
                The clinician web app consisted of an onboarding dashboard and new patient assignment email/sms
                notifications.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h4>Kickoff</h4>
            <h2>We started by consolidating our collective knowledge & outstanding questions</h2>
            <p>
                We didn’t have a clear goal, but we knew we had to build a product that helped them in their day-to-day
                work — We had to "make it better.” The core team and I started by mapping out the existing experience to
                identify steps we wanted to investigate. We filled in the details with qualitative and quantitative data
                from previous research, support tickets, direct conversations, and drop-off/usage data. We identified
                steps in the flow that we wanted to dive deeper into, as well as topics related to new features and
                consult modalities that might be coming in the future. Some points to investigate were:
            </p>
            <img src="">
            <img src="">
            <img src="">
            <p>
                The clinician web app consisted of an onboarding dashboard and new patient assignment email/sms
                notifications.
            </p>
            <li>
                Assignments ignored were 47.2%, so why did we still see 98.7% visits get completed before SLA expired?
            </li>
            <li>
                Why was email CTR low?
            </li>
            <li>
                Are our assumptions around why this isn’t 100% correct?
            </li>
            <li>
                What were clinicians expectations for the product?
            </li>
            <img src="">
            <p>
                For me, the fuzziest piece was tying our product back to Wheel's core value props (providing clinicians
                high flexibility, easy ways to earn, and enabling them to focus on treating the patient). Were we
                delivering on those ideals through the product?
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3>After talking to nine clinicians, we had a clearer idea of the interaction challenges</h3>
            <p>
                We got to see clinicians' workarounds/hacks to be more efficient, which answered a few of our research
                questions.
            </p>
            <img src="">
            <h3>Still, the most significant takeaways were clinicians' attitudes towards work and Wheel</h3>
            <li>
                There was little interaction between clinicians & Wheel
                Aside from assignment emails and the occasional support ticket, clinicians reported no other Wheel
                touchpoints in their day-to-day work. They could go days/weeks before they talked to someone at Wheel.
                Their connection with Wheel could be stronger.
            </li>
            <li>
                Why was eThere was generally low expectations of the software mail CTR low?
                Clinicians said all they want to focus on the patient and not have to figure out the software. Many
                digital tools clinicians have used in the past required them to be an "expert" in operating the
                technology, with cluttered UI and unclear paths to accomplish tasks. It's was no longer a pain point,
                but something they expected — they didn't know it could be better.
            </li>
            <li>
                Transparency could build trust
                Some clinicians felt the need to keep track of visit earnings to ensure they were getting paid the
                correct amount. It's also another record to cover themselves if something went wrong. There’s already a
                lack of trust from being burned from previous experiences.
            </li>
            <li>
                Support & moments of recognition strengthen loyalty
                Many clinicians recalled moments of recognition by patients, peers, or workplace that put their career
                back into perspective. Most noted was our operations/support team's quick and personalized
                communication. They felt like they were kept in the dark at other telehealth companies and felt more
                like a resource. There was also an interesting difference between Wheel clinicians and other gig economy
                workers — they felt like they were a Wheel team member.
            </li>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h4>Reframing the Problem</h4>
            <h2>Clinicians were siloed & didn't have a single place to manage their business & work with Wheel</h2>
            <p>
                Clinicians were isolated from contact with Wheel in their day-to-day work. They didn't have a touchpoint
                that was a mental shift into work mode. A tangible -place- they were excited to go to every day. Our
                goal was to build a home base that sped up the clinician's workflow, helped manage their business
                (earnings, clients, and availability), and made them feel a little more connected to Wheel. With the
                human needs in mind, it was easier for us to tie in quarterly business objectives. Here are a few
                hypotheses we wanted to test:
            </p>
            <li>
                Clinicians who have control over when they work will see a decrease in SLA breaches.
            </li>
            <li>
                Clinicians who have the ability to quickly go from visit to visit will see lower completion times.
            </li>
            <li>
                Clinicians who can view completed visits and earnings will see a decrease in ops hours dedicated to
                sending earning weekly reports.
            </li>

            <img src="">
            <h3>We had so much to do, so we prioritized the most critical use cases for the MVP</h3>
            <p>
                We mapped all our problems (and potential ways to solve them) into larger buckets and narrowed our focus
                areas for the MVP based on the human needs, data on support/operational efficiency, and business impact
                through SLA adherence. The constraints we had to consider were that it had to continue to be a web app
                (due to our engineering team's makeup), and it had to be something we could achieve within the next
                quarter.

            <h4>Design</h4>
            <h2>Priorities were constantly changing at our early-stage startup, so the design needed to be flexible</h2>
            <p>
                The business had a way of changing product priorities based on sales or partnership opportunities. The
                two most prominent features that we kept going back and forth on were synchronous visits and scheduled
                shifts. Those features didn't end up making it into the MVP, but you will see a few concept explorations
                with them attached.
                We also needed the UI components to be flexible. The company was going through a rebrand from Enzyme
                Health to Wheel, so changing the styling had to be quick and straightforward when the time came. You'll
                see two different sets of brand identities as you go through this section.

            <h3>We nailed down the key flows before I started on the interaction framework</h3>
            <p>
                The flows aligned with how we set up our hypotheses and the MVP focus areas.

            <h3>We considered posture and ways to minimize cognitive load</h3>
            <p>
                The product's posture was highly transient. The home screen had to be as simple as a view of their
                current assignment and a button to reduce semantic distance. Distinctive visual design and motion would
                help with spatial cognition as clinicians were continuously bouncing between client platforms.

            <h3>We thought of a few ideas to reduce the steps required to jump from visit to visit</h3>
            <p>
                The goal was to reduce the amount of channels clinicians had to manage while seeing patients. One
                initial idea we had was to utilize browser notifications, which meant they no longer had to open their
                "preferred notification" channel, open the message, and click a link to open the visit. Because of
                constraints around iOS web app notifications, we eventually landed on an iframe we called the utility
                bar.

            <p>
                Not only did clinicians need a way to track how much they were earning, but they needed to feel
                confident Wheel was accurately recording their completed visits. Chaining visits one after the other
                could leave the clinician unsure of the system accurately tracking their volume. Emphasizing the
                earnings with animation narrowed the gulf of interpretation as it gave clear feedback on completed
                visits (equal to their effort) and earnings tallied.

            <h3>We needed a sign from clinicians that they were on/off the clock</h3>
            <p>
                Clinicians could toggle offline to stop receiving new assignments and their associated notifications.
                Flexibility would be in their control. At the same time, Wheel got more insight into the actual
                clinician supply at certain hours of the day, which would help reduce SLA breaches.

            <h3>We leveraged Material as a base for Wheel's design system</h3>
            <p>
                Lots of resources get put into researching, designing, and building Material components. Using Material
                lowered our scope tremendously and allowed us to configure what we needed. It included accessibility and
                a system for theming that allowed us to swap styles for the rebrand easily.

            <h4>Testing & Collaboration</h4>
            <h2>Refining the concept</h2>
            <p>
                The resulting design concept was an analogy to a familiar work setup—a clinical office; An Exam Room. In
                the Exam Room, we were enabling clinicians to:
            </p>
            <li>
                Settle into work mode
            </li>
            <li>
                Have patients automatically triaged
            </li>
            <li>
                Focus on the patient and treatment protocols
            </li>
            <li>
                Be confident in they were getting paid
            </li>
            <li>
                Enjoy coming to the office
            </li>
            <p>
                We put the design in front of eight clinicians to evaluate key tasks and information architecture. I
                created a mock lab requisition assignment with a straightforward protocol to keep the test focused on
                the interactions rather than clinical assessments or protocols. All clinicians accomplished the core
                task flow with no trouble and praised how much faster it was, which gave us confidence in the design.
                However, we saw three participants fail to toggle themselves offline. We also noticed discoverability
                issues with the waiting room. I worked on improving the failure points of the design following the test.

            <h4>What We Shipped</h4>
            <h2>Introducing the Exam Room</h2>
            <p>
                We had a beta round of the new clinician experience, the Exam Room. Our ops team identified a wide range
                of clinicians who partnered with us to test and refine the product. A few months later, we shipped an
                iterated version to a small segment of our clinicians.
